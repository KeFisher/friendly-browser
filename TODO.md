1) Add icons to extension.
2) Update regular expressions to not change words where profanity is a substring of the word.
    -Example ("ass" is in the word "class" so "class" currently gets censored)
3) Put profanity array in file that is not human redable
4) Add the number of words that were censored in a log or UI field.
5) Does the function censor words that are not inside of any tags?
6) Do we need to get all tags on a page or can we just get tags with text inside of them?
